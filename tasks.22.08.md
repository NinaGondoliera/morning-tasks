# Scaling
​
In this exercise, you will be given a scenario where some kind of scaling will need to occur to meet demand.
Read through the scenario and give any pros and cons for **both vertical and horizontal** scaling that you can think of, giving examples as to how that specific feature of scaling would positively or negatively affect the infrastructure, the company, or the client.
​
For example;
​
Horizontal Scaling:
​
    Pro
        Cost: This type of scaling can be cheap on demand for short periods of time.
​
    Con
        Data Synchronisation; When dealing with this kind of scaling, it might be difficult to have consistent data across all instances to provide a consistent user experience.
​
Vertical Scaling
​
    Pros
        Allows for a quick increase in capacity; all the data is accessible in one place; better control over recources.
​
    Cons
        Has a ceiling; one machine or instance is a single point of failure therefore decreasing redundancy. 
​
## Scenario
​
An e-commerce website experiences a sudden surge in traffic due to a flash sale event. The website needs to handle the increased load efficiently to ensure smooth user experience and prevent downtime.

* Elastic Scaling might be the best option, since the increasd capacoty is only needed for a short time, then scale back down again. 
​
## Extension
​
What scaling decision would you choose and what steps do you think you might take to achieve the desired infrastructure?
