# Cloud Concepts and VPC
​
1. What are the difference between a server and your computer?

Server is a machine not necessarily on the same premises as the computer, it can host many computers. Servers provide power and connection to computers. 
Computer is an individual machine, like a laptop or a PC. ​


2. How can you tell whether an IP address is public or private?

Private IP addresses often start with 192.168. .... , and are not accessible from outside the subnetwork. They are numbers assigned to different devices on the subnetwork. #
Public IP addresses are accessible from anywhere, they contain country and region information. 

​
3. Explain in your own words the difference between Cloud, Hybrid, and On-Premises deployment models.

Cloud model uses cloud services to connect via cloud to a server elsewhere, and thus use either virtual machines or virtual machines with software. Servers are maintenanced by the cloud provider and additional storage/capacity is available on demand from the cloud service provider. 

On-premises model uses servers on the premises, maintenanced by the company itself. Additional storage/capacity for the server has to be physically installed. 

Hybrid model uses both the Cloud service provider and on-premise servers for different parts of the business, i.e. some databases may be stored on-premises, but development and testing of large-scale apps or functionality is done via virtual machines on the lcoud server.
